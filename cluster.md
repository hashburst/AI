### Integration with Cluster Mining:

After generating configuration files, the nodes/workers within your mining cluster can execute the generated scripts, allowing them to connect to the respective mining pools with the given algorithms and accounts.

These tools will integrate with the broader Hashburst AI and blockchain framework to optimize node and worker managementâ€‹. See: [Hashburst Blockchain](https://github.com/hashburst/blockchain)
